Hello, welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vinicius Berto, a programmer with a few years of experience in WEB and Mobile development. I currently work with Laravel and Vue.JS stacks, but I've already developed some projects with Node JS and React. I started developing software in 2017 during my graduation. Today I believe that I have mastered a wide range of technologies including HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, MySQL as well as a solid knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming and some design patterns like MVC, Singleton, Factory, Facade, and Observer and of course always looking to learn more every day. So far, I've created systems and apps that I'm very grateful for, as I had to face countless challenges and solve big problems that helped me to be the professional I am.
